  bioDescription: I had a nightmare one time where I needed to buy some concert tickets and I got caught in an infinite loop of loading screens and reCAPTCHA's and getting scammed on Craigslist. Well recently, I think New York's very own SeatGeek heard my cries and came down from the heavens with some of the coolest innovation in online tech since Twilio. It's like I'm running NASA's central control board of event ticketing.
