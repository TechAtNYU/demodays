#DemoDays is gonna be huge!

We've teamed up with Parsons, Cooper Union, and Columbia University to bring you the absolute best student demos NYC has to offer. Be prepared for an explosion of student innovation and ingenuity. As if the mind-blowing demos are not enough, we're giving you a chance to mingle with the top creative students of NYC and some amazing food. At Spotify. Sick? Sick.
