#Local Hack Day + DemoDays

Join tech@NYU, [NYU Poly EIA](https://www.facebook.com/Eianyupoly), [Create@Cooper](http://createatcooper.org/), and [Major League Hacking](http://localhackday.mlh.io/) for a very special DemoDays event on December 6th, 2014. We are co-hosting the NYC node of the first MLH Local Hack Day, a nationwide distributed hack day. 


Celebrate the Fall semester with us at Pivotal Labs for a full day of hacking, socializing, and fun. At Pivotal Labs, we will have food, a Hardware workshop by Create@Cooper, student demos, and a Keynote Speaker. We will also be joined by students across the country for workshops and in livestreams.

Local Hack Day starts at 9AM and goes until 9PM. Join us for hacking, or come to the joint DemoDays and Founder's Forum between 5-7PM!
