#DemoDays will rock your world!

This time, we've teamed up with Parsons Code Club, Create@Cooper and Columbia ADI to serve up some mouth-watering demos. Join us at Spotify's sick new office to watch some really cool student demos, meet interesting people, and eat some great food.

Doors open at 2:30pm, the show starts at 3:00pm.
