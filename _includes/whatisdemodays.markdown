#What is DemoDays?

DemoDays is a monthly student-run event in NYC, organized by tech@NYU, Parsons Code Club, Create@Cooper and Columbia ADI. We're all about fostering a community of students who create things. We want to provide a platform for student builders to present their work, to celebrate their creations, and let that inspire other students to build projects they care about.
