##About

Event page and [archive](http://demodays.co/archive) for tech@NYU DemoDays in NYC. Live at [demodays.co](http://demodays.co)

##Site

DemoDays is built entirely in Jekyll. There is no backend or DB. The archives pages are done with lots of YAML and Liquid, taking advantage of the built-in {{post.date}} for layout.
